Salesforce Developer Catalyst Self-Learning &amp; Super Badges

I have use APEX Triggers, APEX Classes, APEX Testing Framework, Asynchronous APEX and APEX Callouts to do the badges related to APEX.
I have used Apex Triggers concept in automating record creation, used Apex coding for scheduling synchronization, and used REST callouts for synchronizing data. 
I have used APEX Testing for testing logics like auotmation,integration and scheduling for confirming side effects, calling mocks and to confirm actions which are queued.
